# Executive Summary
The test execution results for the `TreeNode` class and the `averageOfLevels` function have been analyzed. The tests covered various scenarios including happy paths, edge cases, and exceptions.

## Test Coverage Analysis
The test plan covered the following components:
1. `TreeNode` class
2. `averageOfLevels` function

### TreeNode Tests
- **Test Case 1**: Create a `TreeNode` with value 5 and no children. **Passed**
- **Test Case 2**: Create a `TreeNode` with value 5, left child with value 3, and right child with value 7. **Passed**
- **Test Case 3**: Create a `TreeNode` with value 0 and no children. **Passed**
- **Test Case 4**: Create a `TreeNode` with value -5 and no children. **Passed**
- **Test Case 5**: Attempt to create a `TreeNode` with a non-numeric value. **Passed** (raised TypeError)

### averageOfLevels Tests
- **Test Case 1**: Balanced tree with levels [3, 9, 20, null, null, 15, 7]. **Passed**
- **Test Case 2**: Unbalanced tree with levels [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. **Passed**
- **Test Case 3**: Tree with a single node [5]. **Passed**
- **Test Case 4**: Tree with negative values [-1, -2, -3]. **Passed**
- **Test Case 5**: Tree with non-numeric values (should raise an exception). **Passed** (raised TypeError)
- **Test Case 6**: Empty tree. **Passed**

## Detailed Test Results
All test cases passed successfully. The `TreeNode` class and the `averageOfLevels` function behave as expected under various scenarios.

## Recommendations for Improvement
1. **Increase Test Coverage**: Add more test cases for edge cases, such as extremely large or small values.
2. **Test Performance**: Evaluate the performance of the `averageOfLevels` function for very large trees.
3. **Error Handling**: Ensure that error messages are informative and helpful for debugging.
